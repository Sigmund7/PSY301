      <description>###Data Wrangling
Repeated measures spreadsheets are usually set up in “wide” format, with a row for each subject and a column for each observation. R requires that the data be in “long” format, with a column for Subject numbers, a second column for Trials, and a third column for Scores. We will be using a data set (Kwide) which is in the wide format.The “head” command will show us the first several rows of data.</description>

      <description>Like any blogdown post, a slumdown post is written in R Markdown, and uses a few custom fields in the YAML field. This tutorial provides an illustration of how different kinds of content are displayed.</description>

      <title>Tutorial part 3: Colour palettes in slumdown</title>

      <guid>/post/colour-palettes/</guid>
      <description>The main reason I wrote slumdown (besides boredom) was to make it easy to  include user-defined colours palettes in blogdown, and expose those palettes to R so that (for instance) plots can be drawn in a style that matches the blog style. This tutorial introduces this palette system.</description>

      <description>Slumdown allows the user to control the background image at the top of each post, the profile image overlaid in the middle of that image, and the caption attached to the header image. This post describes how this is done.</description>

      <title>Tutorial part 5: Deploying to GitHub</title>

      <description>This tutorial describes how to deploy a site. Blogdown sites are very often deployed to Netlify, but I have a personal bias to use GitHub Pages, so &lt;em&gt;slumdown&lt;/em&gt; is configured by default to use GitHub.</description>

      <description>A simple project page illustrating how user-defined themes in &lt;em&gt;slumdown&lt;/em&gt; can be used as the basis of individual pages and ggplot2 figures. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do very much.</description>

      <description> Resources for PSY 301 This website contains resources for my undergraduate statistics students as well as material that might be of use to students Research Methods and Senior Seminar. Most of these resources are available in the learning management system for PSY 301 but, for students not currently enrolled in that class, this may be a more accessable resource.
