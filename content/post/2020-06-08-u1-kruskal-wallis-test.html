<p>If the assumptions of the ANOVA are not met, we might choose to perform a Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kruskal.test(WeightLoss ~ Diet)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
## 
## data:  WeightLoss by Diet
## Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 15.902, df = 3, p-value = 0.001188</code></pre>
<p>Note: Some versions of R seem to require that the group variable be an integer rather than a character for the kruskal.test command. I added a third column (NumDiet) to the spreadsheet which replaced the character variable “Diet” with an integer value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kruskal.test(WeightLoss ~ NumDiet)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
## 
## data:  WeightLoss by NumDiet
## Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 15.902, df = 3, p-value = 0.001188</code></pre>
<p>Previous versions of R could handle the character variable, so this feature may return in the future (it works with the version currently on my computer). Until then, if you have a grouping variable that is coded as character, a numeric replacement may be required.</p>
<p>Note that, in this case, the outcome is very similar to that of the ANOVA.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no equivalent to the Tukey HSD for the K-W test so post hoc comparisons have to be done with a Mann-Whitney test.</p>
